##Description 
An implementation of the D-recognize algorithm 
### What you will find  
- main.py: Our main source code for the d_recognize algorithm (prints out D1,D2,D3) 
    - code description: 
        - The code takes as input a finite state machine and a string. 
        - It then calls three functions:
            - d_recognize (...) : which takes parameters the tape inputted by the user as a parameter , the transitionTable, the symbols, and the accepted_states.                  It will output "accepted" if the string is accepted by the machine and "rejected" otherwise.This covers the D1 deliverable 
            - check_front (...) : takes in the same parameters as d_recognize. It will detect matches in a string where the match is not necessarily right at the
beginning of the string. 
            - check_front_back: takes in the same parameters as d_recognize. It will detect matches even if there are more characters in the string after the matching part.
- Two sub-folders 
    1. sheep: Where the sheep language machine txt files are located   
    2. great: This is where you will find our own machine for D4, it accepts the words "great!" or "Greater!" or "Greatest"
        - For our new machine our regex language would be: (great!|greater!|greatest!) *****Check this
